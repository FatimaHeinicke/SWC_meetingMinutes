# Instructor training and recruitment
##Instructor training

- Next instructor workshop in Oslo is planned for earlt August 2017 
- No pre-requirements needed to participate but it is advisable to be familiar with software/data carpentry and their teaching philosophy
- Post-requirements:
	- Finish workshop tasks within 90 days after finishing the course
	- Teach a SWC or DC course within a year after finishing the instuctor workshop 

##Instructor recruitment

- Suggesting for recruting new instructors:
	- "Headhunt" people directly
	- Have mentors ("old" instructors) that recruit new ones
	- Give instructors credits (in form of ETCS) for teaching (Lex is sceptical because he wants not to loose the "dugnads"-spirit)
